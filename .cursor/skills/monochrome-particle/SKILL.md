  Build or port a configurable full-viewport Three.js layered particle wave

  Code–based agents, or paste into web UIs). Does NOT cover page transitions,
  SandstormProvider, sandstorm hooks, button-triggered navigation, or route

# Monochrome Particle

## Portability

This package is **not Cursor-specific**. It is a portable `SKILL.md` plus supporting Markdown and a TypeScript example. Use it anywhere the model can read files or pasted instructions:

- **Cursor:** project or user `.cursor/skills/monochrome-particle/`, or `npx skills add itsyuvallavi/monochrome-particle` when supported.
- **Other IDEs and agents:** follow that product’s documented location for skills, rules, custom instructions, or repository context; if none exists, attach `SKILL.md` and `reference.md` to the chat or add them to your project’s agent configuration file.

Tool-specific install mechanics may differ; the **implementation contract** (customization surface, shaders, cleanup) does not.

## Scope

Build a background-only React/Next.js component that owns a fixed full-viewport canvas, `WebGLRenderer`, layered `THREE.Points`, buffer geometry with `delay` and `distance` attributes, vertex + fragment shaders, circular sprite texture, animation loop, resize handling, visibility handling, and full WebGL cleanup.

Do not implement or document these as part of this skill:

- `SandstormProvider`, `sandstorm-transition`, `stormIntensityRef`, or syncing storm intensity to routes
- "Explore work" or any other button driving the background or navigation
- `contentOpacityFromStormIntensity` or fading page chrome with storm
- Any Next.js transition tied to clicking a CTA

If a source implementation contains storm shader code, remove it or keep `uStormIntensity` fixed at `0`. Do not add context providers or navigation triggers.

## Customization Contract

Every implementation generated from this skill must expose a simple prop or config API so future LLM requests can safely change the visual result without editing raw shader constants.

Required customization surface:

- `colors`: three gradient stops (`start`, `mid`, `end`) as hex strings or RGB values
- `speed`: animation speed multiplier
- `direction`: `{ x, y }` flow vector used by the wave shader
- `density`: particle density multiplier; changing it rebuilds geometry
- `pointSize`: point-size multiplier
- `opacity`: alpha multiplier

Prefer shader uniforms for runtime-safe visual changes:

- `uColorStart`, `uColorMid`, `uColorEnd`
- `uFlowDirection`
- `uPointSizeMultiplier`
- `uOpacityMultiplier`

When the user asks "make it blue and gold", "slow it down", "reverse direction", "make it denser", "make the dots smaller", or similar, edit the config/props first. Do not ask the user to edit GLSL constants for common visual changes.

## Implementation Recipe

- Use a `"use client"` React component with `useEffect` and `useRef`.
- Install `three` and `@types/three`.
- Use `PerspectiveCamera(75, width / height, 0.1, 2000)` with `camera.position.z = 500`.
- Use `WebGLRenderer` with `powerPreference: "high-performance"`, `alpha: false`, `depth: false`, `stencil: false`, and capped DPR (`Math.min(devicePixelRatio, 2)`).
- Build 2 to 3 particle layers using `BufferGeometry`, `ShaderMaterial`, `THREE.Points`, and additive blending.
- Generate a 32x32 radial-gradient canvas texture for soft circular particles.
- Use distance from the top-left plane origin for the cyan/purple/pink-style gradient, but keep actual colors configurable through uniforms.
- Animate with `requestAnimationFrame`, time deltas, and a capped delta to avoid jumps after tab inactivity.
- Skip rendering while the tab is hidden.
- On cleanup, cancel rAF, remove listeners, dispose textures/geometries/materials/renderer, and clear the scene.

## Files To Read

- Read `reference.md` for shader contracts, sizing, layers, and performance rules.
- Read `examples/MonochromeDotsBackground.tsx` for a complete background-only component with configurable colors, speed, direction, density, point size, and opacity.

## Integration

- Mount the component once near the app root.
- Canvas should be `fixed inset-0 h-full w-full -z-10`.
- Page content should sit above it with `relative z-10`.
- Keep the component independent from routes, buttons, and page transitions.

## Verification

- Changing `colors`, `speed`, `direction`, `density`, `pointSize`, or `opacity` produces the expected visual change.
- Resize and tab hide/show work without console errors.
- Unmounting disposes textures, geometries, materials, and renderer resources.
- No references to sandstorm, route transitions, or CTA-triggered navigation are introduced.
